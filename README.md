# gdoor
A raspberry pi zero project that:
1) uses the gpio lib to read digital inputs on some loop rate
2) write the door status to a sqlite3 database/table (garage/door_state)
3) use php in apache to display the status on a network accessable webpage

This project is just to learn how to do raspberry pi projects. The program is written in c++, since that what I know.
The raspberry pi zero w/ a 16G sd card can run standard programs and this project will push some assumptions on what 
I can build and run with moderate performance.
